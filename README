nzbverify
=========

``nzbverify`` is a command-line tool and library for verifying the integrity of
an NZB file.  It is capable of supporting both standard and SSL-encrypted NNTP
connections and employs threads for increased verification speed.

As of version 0.3.0 it also supports multiple servers, including primary and
backup servers.

Usage
-----

As of version 0.3.0, a configuration file is required.  The configurtion file
should be formatted as a "netrc" file.  Here is an example configuration,
including both a primary and a backup server:

	machine ssl.mynewshost.com
		login		username1
		password	123456789
		account		port=443,connections=20,ssl=true

	machine news.somenewshost.net
		login		username2
		password 	987654321
		account		port=119,connections=2,backup=true,ssl=false


The example below reads the NNTP server information from ``~/.netrc``::

  $ nzbverify tests/nzbs/ubuntu-12_04-dvd-amd64_iso.nzb
