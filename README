nzbverify
=========

``nzbverify`` is a command-line tool and library for verifying the integrity of
an NZB file.  It is capable of supporting both standard and SSL-encrypted NNTP
connections and employs threads for increased verification speed.

Usage
-----

The example below reads the NNTP server information from ``~/.netrc``, connects
via port 443 (using SSL implicitly) and opens 15 connections to the server::

  $ nzbverify -P 443 -n 15 tests/nzbs/ubuntu-12_04-dvd-amd64_iso.nzb
